# RICE

RICE (Rust-based Intelligent Chess Engine) is a chess engine written in Rust. It is currently in its early development phase and aims to provide advanced chess-playing capabilities.

## Starting the server
Run the following command to start a dev server
```
cargo watch -x run 
```

## Features

- Alpha-beta pruning: RICE utilizes the alpha-beta pruning algorithm to efficiently search for optimal moves and improve its decision-making process.

- Web server: The engine includes a small web server that allows users to access and interact with the engine through a web interface.

## Future Plans

My future plans for RICE include:

- Integration with a Node.js chess backend and frontend: I aim to connect RICE with a Node.js-based chess backend and frontend, creating a full-stack chess application that provides a seamless and immersive chess-playing experience.
- Fine tuning the engine and introducing more parameters to evaluate a board state.
